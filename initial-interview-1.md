The technologies we use include PHP, Java, and Angular with Redux for state management. My responsibilities involve developing and maintaining the system, ensuring its performance and reliability. Throughout my career, I have also taken on roles such as software architect and solutions architect, where I designed system architectures, led development teams, and ensured high-quality project delivery."

## 4. Why do you want to leave your current job?

"My current job poses many advantages, but... throughout my career I'm just working in Brazil
I want a taste of a more diverse working environment"

(If necessary: .. )

After the pandemic, remote work opportunities have increased, and I see this as a chance to work on international projects and collaborate with people from different cultures. I believe this would be a great professional experience and aligns with my current career goals."

## 5. Talk about your previous job.
**Answer:**
In my previous job I worked as a Solutions Architect in a large telecommunications company, I designed systems focused on information security, using various technologies such as biometric systems, fraud analysis tools and others. It was very important for my career because I developed my software skills such as speaking to a large audience and negotiating technological solutions.

## 6. What are your future goals and why are you interested in this position?
**Answer:**
"My future goals include developing my leadership and management skills while continuing to work in a technical role. I am interested in roles that let me innovate and use new technologies. This position excites me because it offers the chance to work on challenging projects and help the company grow. Also, it would be a unique opportunity to work with people from different countries and cultures, sharing knowledge and experiences."

Effective communication with team members and stakeholders also helps me manage expectations and maintain focus on the most critical tasks."

## 8. Can you give an example of a time when you had to learn a new technology quickly? How did you approach it?
**Answer:**
"As I gained experience over the years, I found it easier to learn new technologies and methodologies. I worked on various projects, which helped me develop strong learning skills. For example, when I needed to learn a new technology, I would start by researching and reading official documentation. I would then practice by building small projects and seek advice from colleagues who were familiar with the technology. This approach helped me quickly become proficient in new tools and techniques.

In the beginning of my career, I had a hard time learning new technologies quickly. But over time, with my experience, my mind became faster at learning. For instance, two years ago, I needed to work on a project that used Python. I got fluency in this programming language in about two weeks. Learning a new programming language becomes easier when you already know others because you understand the core concepts."

## 9. How do you handle feedback and criticism?
**Answer:**
"I view feedback and criticism as opportunities for growth. When receiving feedback, I listen carefully and ask clarifying questions to fully understand the perspective. I reflect on the feedback and identify specific areas for improvement."

## 10. What is a significant achievement in your career so far?
**Answer:**

"One significant achievement was developing a dynamic form with 465 questions and multiple dashboards for strategic decision-making. The problem was the high complexity and a tight deadline due to an upcoming event. I talked with the company's leadership to put together a team and managed the whole process, from planning to coding. Besides managing, I also programmed the system. This required both hard skills in coding and system architecture, and soft skills in leadership, project management, and communication. The result was a successful on-time delivery, showing my leadership and technical skills.

Another case at my current job at AGU involved fixing serious slowdowns in a critical system with many integrations and a lot of users. The system had to process a lot of data at once, which was slowing it down and making it hard for users to use. I found problems like repeated service calls, bad database queries, and wrong use of Angular components, including poor garbage collector management. After fixing these, we improved performance by 60%, making the system much better. This required hard skills in performance analysis, database optimization, and code refactoring, as well as soft skills in problem-solving and technical communication."

## 11. How do you stay updated with the latest industry trends and technologies?
**Answer:**
"I stay updated with the latest industry trends and technologies by regularly reading tech blogs, following industry leaders on social media, and participating in online forums and communities. I also attend webinars, conferences, and workshops whenever possible. Continuous learning through online courses and certifications helps me keep my skills current and relevant"

## 12. Can you explain a time when you had to resolve a conflict within your team?
**Answer:**
"Once, there was a disagreement between two team members regarding the approach to a critical project. I facilitated a meeting where each member could express their viewpoints and concerns. We discussed the pros and cons of each approach and sought a compromise that incorporated the best elements of both ideas. By fostering open communication and focusing on the project's objectives, we were able to resolve the conflict and move forward productively."

## 13. How do you ensure quality in your work?
**Answer:**
"I ensure quality in my work by following best practices and industry standards. This includes writing clean, maintainable code and conducting thorough code reviews. I also use automated testing and continuous integration tools to catch issues early. Regularly seeking feedback from peers and stakeholders helps identify areas for improvement. Staying updated with the latest advancements in technology and methodologies also contributes to maintaining high-quality standards."

## 14. What strategies do you use to manage stress and stay productive?
**Answer:**
"To manage stress and stay productive, I prioritize my tasks and break them into smaller steps. I set realistic goals and take regular breaks to recharge. Exercise and mindfulness, like meditation, help me stay clear and focused. Good time management and keeping a healthy work-life balance are also important for managing stress and staying productive."

## 15. How do you approach professional development and continuous learning?
**Answer:**
"I approach professional development and continuous learning by setting clear goals and seeking out opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. This includes enrolling in courses, attending workshops and conferences, and reading industry publications. I also participate in professional networks and communities to learn from peers and share knowledge. Regularly reflecting on my progress and seeking feedback helps me stay on track and continuously improve."

## 16. What are your greatest strengths and weaknesses?
**Answer:**
"My greatest strengths are my ability to adapt quickly to new technologies and my strong problem-solving skills. I enjoy learning and continuously improving my skills. Additionally, I am someone who values creating a positive work environment, respecting my colleagues, and actively seeking and providing feedback. For example, in my previous role, I quickly learned and implemented a new cloud computing technology, which was crucial for completing a critical project on time.

One of my weaknesses is that I tend to be a perfectionist. Over the years, I have developed skills to balance this by setting realistic goals and deadlines. For critical projects involving high risk, I increase my attention to detail, which might slow me down slightly but ensures high-quality delivery. Besides perfectionism, I am also constantly working on improving my communication and time management skills. By managing my perfectionism, I can deliver projects efficiently while maintaining high standards."
