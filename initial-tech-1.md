# Tech Interview - Part 1

## 1. What is TDD (Test-Driven Development)?
**Answer:**
"TDD stands for Test-Driven Development. It is a software development process where you write tests for a feature before writing the actual code. The cycle involves writing a test, making it pass by writing code, and then refactoring the code to improve it."

## 2. Can you explain the concept of Clean Code?
**Answer:**
"Clean Code refers to writing code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. It follows best practices such as meaningful naming, simple design, and thorough testing. Clean code helps improve collaboration and reduces the chance of bugs."

## 3. What are Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)?
**Answer:**
"Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers' code changes into a shared repository several times a day. Continuous Deployment (CD) is the process of automatically deploying code changes to production after they pass all tests. Both practices aim to make development faster and more reliable."

## 4. What is an API and how is it used?
**Answer:**
"API stands for Application Programming Interface. It allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define a set of rules and protocols for accessing web services, making it easier to integrate different systems and share data."

## 5. Can you explain the basics of Docker?
**Answer:**
"Docker is a tool that allows developers to create, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers package an application with all its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently in any environment. This makes deployment and scaling easier."

## 6. What is Kubernetes and what is it used for?
**Answer:**
"Kubernetes is an open-source platform for managing containerized applications. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, making it easier to run large-scale applications reliably."

## 7. How do you ensure code quality?
**Answer:**
"I ensure code quality by following best practices such as writing clean and maintainable code, conducting code reviews, and using automated testing. Tools like linters and static code analyzers also help identify potential issues early."

## 8. What is a microservice architecture?
**Answer:**
"Microservice architecture is a design approach where an application is composed of small, independent services that communicate over a network. Each service is responsible for a specific functionality and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently."

## 9. How do you manage version control in your projects?
**Answer:**
"I use version control systems like Git to manage code changes. I create branches for new features or bug fixes, commit changes with clear messages, and merge them into the main branch after review. This helps keep track of changes and collaborate with the team effectively."

## 10. What is the purpose of automated testing?
**Answer:**
"Automated testing aims to ensure that the code works as expected by running tests automatically. It helps catch bugs early, saves time compared to manual testing, and ensures consistent test coverage. Automated tests can include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests."

## 11. What is a RESTful API?
**Answer:**
"A RESTful API is an API that follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). It uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources, which are identified by URLs. RESTful APIs are stateless and can be easily integrated with web services."

## 12. Can you explain OAuth2?
**Answer:**
"OAuth2 is an authorization framework that allows third-party applications to access a user's resources without sharing their credentials. It provides secure access using access tokens. I have experience using OAuth2 with tools like Keycloak and SailPoint for managing authentication and authorization."

## 13. What is an API Gateway?
**Answer:**
"An API Gateway is a server that acts as an intermediary between clients and backend services. It handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management."

## 14. What is your experience with cloud services?
**Answer:**
"I have experience using various cloud services such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. These platforms offer a range of services for computing, storage, and networking. Cloud services help improve scalability, reliability, and flexibility of applications."
